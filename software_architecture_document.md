# Software Architecture Document #

## 2. Architectural Representation ##
---
In our project we are using a MVW (Model View Whatever) model. Whatever describes a complex constellation of different controllers and models an client and server side. To get an overview to this architecture you should have a look on:

[MVC Overview](http://unverschaemt.net/stockparty/MVC.html)

Detailed client-side UML Diagram:
[UML Class Diagram Client](http://unverschaemt.net/stockparty/Class%20Diagram%20Client.html)


## 3. Architectural Goals and Constraints ##
---
Our goal is to be able to change each part of the software easily without any influence to other parts. We havenâ€™t a certain tool to provide this because it is not necessary because of our architecture.
