# Software Architecture Document #

## 2. Architectural Representation ##    
---
In our project we are using a MVW (Model View Whatever) model. Whatever describes a complex constellation of different controllers and models an client and server side. To get an overview to this architecture you should have a look on:
MVC.html
Detailed server-side UML Diagram: Class Diagram.html
Detailed client-side UML Diagram: Class Diagram Client.html


## 3. Architectural Goals and Constraints ## 
---
Our goal is to be able to change each part of the software easily without any influence to other parts. We haven’t a certain tool to provide this because it is not necessary because of our architecture.
